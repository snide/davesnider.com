# Website for Dave Snider

https://davesnider.com

This site is powered by [Astro][0], Svelte[5], [Turso][1], [Cloudflare][7] and hosted on [Vercel][2]. It is provided publicly so others can learn from the code, but please do not copy the design.

The fonts are paid-fonts I've licensed through [SG Type][3] and [Berkeley Graphics][4]. Using these fonts in your your own project without obtaining your own license is illegal and not very cool.

## Credentials

You'll need access to a [Xata][1] API key to run the museum locally. If you're curious, I wrote up a detailed blog about how it works over [here][6]

## Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                 | Action                                           |

| `pnpm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
