    <h1>About the author</h1>
    <p>
      Hello random visitor. My name is Dave Snider. I've been working with computers in some form or another since the
      early 90s when I hacked away on an old IBM PS2 and a pre-www Prodigy account. Previously I've built companies from
      scratch and run big teams for large companies, but these days I take joy from working daily in design code. I
      currently work at Xata as a Designer.

      I am 43 years old and live in Annapolis, Maryland with my wife, two kids, and many animals. I collect hobbies and
      enjoy learning new things constantly. This site often logs my awkward attempts to master them, but often I just
      move on to something new once I've figured out the basics. I am forever a beginner who approaches life with an
      unbreakable optimism inherited from Star Trek and The Muppets.

      Here is the rough memory of some major events in my life, along with some mentions of the people and art that
      shaped my opinions.
