It isn't the height of fine woodworking, but I wanted a large cork board for my game room to pin up kid's artwork and notes from my D&D group. It measures nearly 8 feed tall by about 4 feet wide and is built out of $10 worth of 1x3 pine boards and a roll of cork sheeting I got from Amazon. The hardest party was attaching the heavy frame to the wall studs with a french cleat. I assembled everything in the basement, using my existing game table as a work surface. I'm sure I'll be cleaning dust out of the basement for weeks to come, but it was too cold to work outside!
