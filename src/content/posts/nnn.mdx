import Video from '@components/video/video.astro';

It's been roughly a month since I started using NNN as a daily driver for file management. I've found it indispensable in my toolkit and getting into the spirit of open source was happy to provide some PRs to allow their icon system to utilize nerd fonts. The team there saw my first video and asked me to make one that showed off the plugin system in depth. I went ahead and re-shot the video, which feels a little more complete now that I'm more familiar with the NNN source code. I enjoy the gig of explaining super-nerdy open source programs and might continue making more of them for the community.
