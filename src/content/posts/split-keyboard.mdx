Over the last year I've become a fan of ortholinear layouts, which use a straight grid for the keyboard layout versus the normal typewriter-style stagger. The only negative of using such a small keyboard though is that it doesn't do anything for your actual arm position and ends up being a little cramp. I figured I'd try one of the new Let's split style layouts out, but wanted to create my own case. This was actually much harder than it looks because I had to route out the inner portion and then cut everything away afterwards.
