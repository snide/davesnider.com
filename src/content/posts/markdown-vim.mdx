I'm a big vim fan. It feeds my needs for customization and over the years I've made an editor that feels very tailored to the way my brain works. In my job I write lots of documentation, almost always with markdown files, which are easy to write but can get unweildy with large documents. I was also somewhat jealous of Markdown editors like Ulysses, but really missed vims navigation and general text commands. Using Goyo, vim-markdown and vim-pencil I was able to get what I consider the best markdown writing experience possible.
