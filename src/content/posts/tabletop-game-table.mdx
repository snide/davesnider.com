Unfortunately I haven't had much time to game lately, but over the Summer I built out a sunken table for Tabletop games. Over the years I'd gotten used to the digital frills of Tabletop Simulator for setting up my games during Covid, but I wanted to get back to playing in person. I'd seen some YouTube videos that showed elaborate setups where TVs were placed inside tables so you could pipe your maps onto a digital service. I slightly changed the model by allowing my inner TV frame to be removable so the surface you still be used as a regular board game surface if needed. Rather than construct a table base I opted for a cheap Husky table base for more support and so that the whole table top could raise like a standing desk.
