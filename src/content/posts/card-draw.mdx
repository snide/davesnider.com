I've gotten back into 3D printing after I picked up a [Bambu Labs P2S](https://bambulab.com/en-us/p2s). It has come in handy for printing board game inserts to keep everything organized and easy to setup and breakdown my table. Recently I designed a simple card deck draw after playing [Wolfpack](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/325020/wolfpack-the-north-atlantic-convoy-struggles-octob), which has six separate decks you pull from each round. Since I tend to sleeve my cards, keeping the stacks from falling over was a challenge during the game, and I figured if I could make something modular, they'd be useful for other card games as well.

You can find the original Tinker Cad file [here](https://www.tinkercad.com/things/c5cXHzdU6aL-magnetic-card-deck-draw?sharecode=HohpivZxeGL3iz1Kc7loYa-1MLnsOGgzL0uocsHgT2Q). The model allows for four [3x6mm magnets](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F8BGRJ5L) in the corners to allow for alignment of multiple decks. The slight angle at the base keeps typically tippy stacks of sleeved cards from falling over and creates an easy draw from the top.

I've learned a lot about physical UX affordance designing these simple prints. Along with the slanted base, there are finger slots at the bottom and sides which make it easy to grab the stack from the bottom when you need to breakdown your game and put it back in the box.

The model doesn't require supports for printing and should work fine with using generic PLA with 20% infill.
