"What is your screenshot program?" is a question I get asked by new coworkers within my first day of meeting them. It makes sense. As a designer I am a screenshot machine, showing off little bits of my work all day. "What do you think of this?". Then minutes later... "OK, but this is better right?". In general, this means you can capture my work output by the number of screenshots I shared that day.

Thirteen years ago I had the prescience to know those screenshots were valuable beyond their ephemeral nature. They were a ledger of work no different than my GitHub activity. After all, I'm a designer who works mostly in the browser. Photoshop and Figma files live in a pretty-state almost forever, but a living website? It changes daily. The best Figma prototype is ugly with the wrong content in that layout. Good web design adapts to the content, and it's why I've always favored working in the medium of the browser directly.

```fish
gsutil ls -l 'gs://cloudsite/**' | awk '$1 > 200*1024*1024' | sort -n -k1,1 | awk '{print $NF}' > large_files.txt
```

Compressing large files with ffmpeg. This saved Total space saved: 34507.784035 MiB which is 36.19 GB. Total bucket size is now 23.5137 GB

```fish
set total_saved 0; for file in (cat large_files.txt); set filename (basename $file); set original_size (gsutil du $file | awk '{print $1}'); gsutil cp $file $filename; and ffmpeg -i $filename -c:v libx264 -b:v 1M -r 30 "compressed_$filename"; and gsutil cp "compressed_$filename" $file; and set compressed_size (gsutil du $file | awk '{print $1}'); set total_saved (math "$total_saved + $original_size - $compressed_size"); rm $filename "compressed_$filename"; end; echo "Total space saved: "(math "$total_saved / (1024*1024)")" MiB"
```
