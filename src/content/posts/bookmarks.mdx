I'm a big fan of bookmarking ALL THE THINGS. If you tag diligently, you end up with a personal mini-web of searchable links. A lot of daily work is pulling up a project spec, design or Github issue. With searhable bookmarks finding that URL is trivial. You'd be amazed at how much time you save in the day.

For years I managed bookmarks with [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/) and an [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) frontend on my Mac. When I moved to Linux that wasn't an option, and I looked for systems that would let me self-host my data. Enter [Buku](https://github.com/jarun/buku), a command-line bookmark manager created by the maker of [NNN](https://github.com/jarun/nnn). With a little bit of [FZF](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) hacking, I was able to make a nice frontend to search through them.

Buku has a lot of features I don't use, and its data model focuses more on exporting rather than syncing. Like my [screenshot](/posts/screenshot-app) project, my dream was to have a local-first editing experience similar that could sync with a [Xata](https://xata.io) database. I ended up building just that by tying some [Fish](https://fishshell.com/), FZF and TypeScript together in a project I dubbed Rollerball.

[Rollerball's source](https://github.com/snide/rollerball) is available on Github if you want something similar for yourself. The video below shows off its strengths: searching and editing your bookmarks fast through the command line.
